    Emulation support for Higher Kinded Types.

    Consider ``KindN`` to be an alias of ``Generic`` type.
    But with some extra goodies.

    ``KindN`` is the top-most type for other ``Kind`` types
    like ``Kind1``, ``Kind2``, ``Kind3``, etc.

    The only difference between them is how many type arguments they can hold.
    ``Kind1`` can hold just two type arguments: ``Kind1[IO, int]``
    which is almost equals to ``IO[int]``.
    ``Kind2`` can hold just two type arguments: ``Kind2[IOResult, int, str]``
    which is almost equals to ``IOResult[int, str]``.
    And so on.

    The idea behind ``KindN`` is that one cannot write this code:

    .. code:: python

      from typing import TypeVar

      T = TypeVar('T')
      V = TypeVar('V')

      def impossible(generic: T, value: V) -> T[V]:
          return generic(value)

    But, with ``KindN`` this becomes possible in a form of ``Kind1[T, V]``.

    .. note::
        To make sure it works correctly,
        your type has to be a subtype of ``KindN``.

    We use a custom ``mypy`` plugin to make sure types are correct.
    Otherwise, it is currently impossible to properly type this.

    We use "emulated Higher Kinded Types" concept.
    Read the whitepaper: https://bit.ly/2ABACx2

    ``KindN`` does not exist in runtime. It is used just for typing.
    There are (and must be) no instances of this type directly.

    .. rubric:: Implementation details

    We didn't use ``ABCMeta`` to disallow its creation,
    because we don't want to have
    a possible metaclass conflict with other metaclasses.
    Current API allows you to mix ``KindN`` anywhere.

    We allow ``_InstanceType`` of ``KindN``
    to be ``Instance`` type or ``TypeVarType`` with ``bound=...``.

    Does nothing in runtime, just returns its argument.

    We use a custom ``mypy`` plugin to make sure types are correct.
    Otherwise, it is currently impossible to properly type this.

    Here's an example of how it should be used:

    .. code:: python

      >>> from typing import TypeVar
      >>> from returns.primitives.hkt import KindN, kinded
      >>> from returns.interfaces.bindable import BindableN

      ... ) -> KindN[_Binds, _Type1, _Type2, _Type3]:
      ...     return container  # just do nothing

    As you can see, here we annotate our return type as
    ``-> KindN[_Binds, _Type1, _Type2, _Type3]``,
    it would be true without ``@kinded`` decorator.

    But, ``@kinded`` decorator dekinds the return type and infers
    the real type behind it:

    .. code:: python

      >>> from returns.io import IO, IOResult

      >>> assert bindable_identity(IO(1)) == IO(1)
      >>> # => Revealed type: 'IO[int]'

      >>> iores: IOResult[int, str] = IOResult.from_value(1)
      >>> assert bindable_identity(iores) == iores
      >>> # => Revealed type: 'IOResult[int, str]'

    The difference is very clear in ``methods`` modules, like:

    - Raw :func:`returns.methods.bind.internal_bind`
      that returns ``KindN`` instance
    - User-facing :func:`returns.methods.bind.bind`
      that returns the container type

    You must use this decorator for your own kinded functions as well.
