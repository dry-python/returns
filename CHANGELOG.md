# Version history

We follow Semantic Versions since the `1.0.0` release.

### Features

- Adds Higher Kinded Types partial support

- **Breaking**: drops `python3.6` support
- **Breaking**: makes our `mypy` plugin not optional, but required!
- **Breaking**: changes all `RequiresContext`-based type arguments order,
  previously we used to specify `_EnvType` as the first type argument,
  now it is the last one. This is done to respect new HKT rules
- **Breaking**: renames `.rescue` to `.lash`
- **Breaking**: removes all old interfaces from `primitives/interfaces.py`,
  use new typeclasses instead
- **Breaking**: ``Maybe`` is fully reworked to be lawful
- **Breaking**: removes `value_or` pointfree method,
  because it is impossible to express with HKT
- **Breaking**: removes `.value_or`, `.unwrap`, and `.failure` methods
  from `FutureResult` and `RequiresContext`-based types,
  because we do require these methods to raise an exception on failure,
  but these methods were lazy and did not raise the required exception
- **Breaking**: changes how `is_successful` is typed:
  now we allow any `Unwrappable` interface instances there,
  including custom ones
- **Breaking**: changes `UnwrapFailedError` constructor,
  now it does accept an `Unwrappable` instance instead of a `BaseContainer`
- **Breaking**: removes `.fix` method from all containers,
  also removes `fix` pointfree function
- **Breaking**: Removes `coalesce` function,
  because it is impossible to properly type it
- **Breaking**: Removes all `Context*` based types with `.ask()` method,
  use new `.ask()` methods on the `Reader`-based containers
- **Breaking**: Now `Future` and `FutureResult` can be awaited multiple times
- **Breaking**: Removes `.unify()` method from several containers,
  use `unify()` pointfree function instead
- **Breaking**: Removes ``.from_iterable`` method from all containers,
  instead adds better `iterables` support,
  we now have `returns.iterables` module with `Fold` helper
- **Breaking**: Renames property `empty` to `no_args` of
  all `RequiresContext`-based classes

  to be similar to `Result` and `IOResult`
- Adds `.swap` method to `Result`, `IOResult`, `FutureResult`,
  and other result based containers

  `Result`, `Maybe`, `IO`, `IOResult`
- Adds missing `from_requires_context_future_result` to `RequiresContext`
- Adds `.from_optional` and `.bind_optional` to `Maybe` container
- Adds `__slots__` to `UnwrapFailedError` with `halted_container`
- Changes `flatten` to work with `KindN` and any possible container
- Adds a helper to test traces to our `pytest` plugin
- Adds `cond` function to `pointfree` and `methods` packages
- Adds `compose_result` HKT method and pointfree function

  now it has a hard limit of 20 parameters
- Fixes that `RequiresContextFutureResult` was not supported by `pytest` plugin
- Fixes incorrect `partial` behaviour in an edge case, #618
- Fixes that `.apply` method of `IOResult` was working incorrectly,
  it was returning `IOFailure(2)`
  as a result of  `IOFailure(1).apply(IOFailure(2))`
- Fixes bug that `safe(tap(...))` was revealing invalid types sometimes

### Misc

- Adds a lot of new typetests
- Checks that now all math laws are checked for all types
- Changes docs structure, adds new `Interfaces`, `HKT`, and `Methods` pages
- Changed `__str__` method in `BaseContainer` class to `__repr__` method

## 0.14.0

### Features

- **Breaking**: renames mypy plugin from `decorator_plugin` to `returns_plugin`
  because of a complete rewrite and lots of new features
- **Breaking**: changes `@safe`, `@impure`, `impure_safe`, `@maybe` semantics:
  they do not work with `async` functions anymore;
  now you are forced to use `Future` and its helpers
  to work with `async` functions
- **Breaking**: renames `Maybe.new` to `Maybe.from_value`.
  Because all our other containers support this protocol.
  Only `Maybe` was different, sorry for that!
- **Breaking**: renames `.from_success()` to `.from_value()`,
  there's no need in two separate methods
- **Breaking**: renames `.from_successful_io()` to `.from_io()`,
  there's no need in two separate methods
- **Breaking**: renames `.from_successful_context()` to `.from_context()`,
  there's no need in two separate methods
- **Breaking**: since we now support `.apply()` method,
  there's no more need in `*_squash` converters, they are removed
- **Breaking**: renamed `Instanceable` to `Applicative`
- **Breaking**: changes `.from_io` and `.from_failed_io` of `IOResult`
  to return `Any` instead of `NoReturn` unfilled type
- **Breaking**: removes `.lift` and `.lift_*` methods from all containers,
  use `map_`, `bind_result`, `bind_io`, and other pointfree helpers instead
- **Breaking**: removes `@pipeline` function. It was a mistake:
  it does not work with mixed container types,
  it does not type failures properly,
  it does not work with ``IO`` and ``Future``,
  it enforces to write imperative code in a functional codebase.
  Use ``flow`` instead

- Adds typed `partial` and `curry` mypy plugins!

- Adds typed `bind_async_future` and `bind_async_future_result`
  pointfree functions

- Adds `flatten` support for `Future`,
  `FutureResult` and `RequiresContextFutureResult`
- Adds `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` magic methods to `Immutable` class
- Speeds up ``is_successful`` function
- Makes all `Context` context helpers abstract,
  so you cannot create new instances of this class,
  also adds `__slots__` to these classes
- Improves `RequiresContext*` types with `NoDeps` where it is logically true

### Bugfixes

  for functions with `Any`

  now we test compatibility with any IO stack: `asyncio`, `trio`, `curio`
- Updates lots of dependencies
- Adds lots of new tests
- Updates lots of docs
- Removes "IO marker" name from docs in favor for "IO container",
  it is not special at all. Why would we call it differently?
