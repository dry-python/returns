Quickstart
==========

Starting is really fast!
You can intergrate ``returns`` into any project at any stage.
You can use it fully or partially. With or without types.

``returns`` is a very flexible library!

You can even just start using it without any deep theory around this project.
But, you can always address our learning materials
which will unravel all parts of functional programming
with useful examples and simple terms.


Installation
------------

``returns`` is a pure Python library. Install it as usual:

.. code:: bash

  pip install returns  # or better use poetry


Typechecking and other integrations
-----------------------------------

This step is optional.
If you use ``mypy`` for type-checking, than you will need to configure it.
We really recommend using ``mypy`` with this project though.
Because we have put a lot of efforts into the typing part.

Check out our docs on :ref:`mypy <mypy-plugins>`.

We also have built-in integrations
with :ref:`pytest <pytest-plugins>` and :ref:`hypothesis <hypothesis-plugins>`.
Also, there is :ref:`developer tooling <development-tooling>` you might enjoy.


Theory
------

Do you want to learn new awesome concepts?
Then, start reading our "Userguide"!

It has everything you need! Reading order matters.

However, this is optional.
You can still use ``returns`` without a deep-dive into theory.


Building your own stuff
-----------------------

You can extend ``returns`` and build your own stuff!
Particullary, you can add new interfaces, new containers, and new integrations.
See :ref:`this guide <create-your-own-container>`.
