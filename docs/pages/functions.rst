Helper functions
================

We feature several helper functions to make your developer experience better.


compose
-------

We also ship an utility function to compose two different functions together.

.. code:: python

  >>> from returns.functions import compose

  >>> bool_after_int = compose(int, bool)
  >>> bool_after_int('1')
  True
  >>> bool_after_int('0')
  False

Composition is also type-safe.
The only limitation is that we only support
functions with one argument and one return to be composed.

Only works with regular functions (not async).


identity
--------

We also ship :func:`returns.functions.identity` function
to help you with the composition.

Identity function is a simple concept: it just returns its argument.
If you wonder why do we need this function, please read below:

- `Practical Usage of Identity Function <https://blog.bigbinary.com/2018/03/20/practical-usage-of-identity-function.html>`_ (JS)
- `Using Identity Functions <https://emilvarga.com/posts/2016/08/01/using-identity-functions>`_ (Scala)


tap and untap
-------------

We need ``tap()`` function to easily compose values
with functions that does not return.
For example you sometimes need to ``print()`` values inside your :ref:`pipe`:

.. code:: python

  >>> from returns.functions import tap

  >>> result = tap(print)(1)  # will print and return 1
  1
  >>> assert result == 1

You can also use ``untap`` function to turn any function
return type to ``None`` and still do its thing"

.. code:: python

  >>> from returns.functions import tap, untap

  >>> result = untap(tap(print))(1)  # will print and return None
  1
  >>> assert result is None

This is also sometimes helpful for a typed function composition.


raise_exception
---------------

Sometimes you really want to reraise an exception from ``Failure[Exception]``
due to some existing API (or a dirty hack).

We allow you to do that with ease!

.. code:: python

  from returns.functions import raise_exception

  @pipeline(Result)
  def create_account_and_user(username: str) -> ...:
      """
      Creates new Account-User pair.

      Imagine, that you need to reraise ValidationErrors due to existing API.
      """
      return _validate_user(
          username,
      ).alt(
          # What happens here is interesting, since you do not let your
          # unwrap to fail with UnwrapFailedError, but instead
          # allows you to reraise a wrapped exception.
          # In this case `ValidationError()` will be thrown
          # before `UnwrapFailedError`
          raise_exception,
      )

  def _validate_user(username: str) -> Result['User', ValidationError]:
      ...

Use this with caution. We try to remove exceptions from our code base.
Original proposal is `here <https://github.com/dry-python/returns/issues/56>`_.


not\_
-----

With ``not_`` helper function we can easily deny a function returns.
It supports functions with one or more arguments.

.. code:: python

  >>> from typing import List

  >>> from returns.functions import compose, not_

  >>> def is_even(number: int) -> bool:
  ...     return number % 2 == 0
  ...

  >>> def number_is_in_list(number: int, list_: List[int]) -> bool:
  ...     return number in list_
  ...

  >>> not_(is_even)(2)
  False
  >>> not_(number_is_in_list)(1, [2, 3, 4])
  True
  >>> compose(int, not_(is_even))("1")
  True
