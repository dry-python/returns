Container: the concept
======================

.. currentmodule:: returns.primitives.container

Container is a concept that allows you
to write code around the existing wrapped values
while maintaining the execution context.

List of supported containers:

- :class:`Maybe <returns.maybe.Maybe>` to handle ``None`` cases
- :class:`IO <returns.io.IO>` to mark explicit ``IO`` actions
- :class:`Result <returns.result.Result>` to handle possible exceptions

We will show you container's simple API of one attribute
and several simple methods.


Basics
------

The main idea behind a container is that it wraps some internal state.
That's what
:py:attr:`._inner_value <returns.primitives.container.Container._inner_value>`
is used for.

And we have several functions
to create new containers based on the previous state.
And we can see how this state is evolving during the execution.

   graph LR
       F1["Container(Initial)"] --> F2["Container(UserId(1))"]
       F2                       --> F3["Container(UserAccount(156))"]
       F3                       --> F4["Container(FailedLoginAttempt(1))"]
       F4                       --> F5["Container(SentNotificationId(992))"]


Working with containers
-----------------------

We use two methods to create a new container from the previous one.
``bind`` and ``map``.

The difference is simple:

- ``map`` works with functions that return regular value
- ``bind`` works with functions that return new container of the same type

:func:`~returns.primitives.container.Bindable.bind`
is used to literally bind two different containers together.

.. code:: python

  from returns.result import Result, Success

  def may_fail(user_id: int) -> Result[float, str]:
      ...

  value: Result[int, str] = Success(1)
  # Can be assumed as either Success[float] or Failure[str]:
  result: Result[float, str] = value.bind(may_fail)

And we have :func:`~returns.primitives.container.Mappable.map`
to use containers with regular functions.

.. code:: python

  from typing import Any
  from returns.result import Success, Result

  def double(state: int) -> int:
      return state * 2

  result: Result[int, Any] = Success(1).map(double)
  # => Success(2)
  result: Result[int, Any] = result.map(lambda state: state + 1)
  # => Success(3)

The same work with built-in functions as well:

.. code:: python

  from returns.io import IO

  IO('bytes').map(list)
  # => <IO: ['b', 'y', 't', 'e', 's']>

Note::

  All containers support these methods.


Railway oriented programming
----------------------------

When talking about error handling we use a concept of
`Railway oriented programming <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/>`_.
It mean that our code can go on two tracks:

1. Successful one: where everything goes perfectly: HTTP requests work,
   database is always serving us data, parsing values does not failed
2. Failed one: where something went wrong

We can switch from track to track: we can fail something
or we can fix the situation.

.. mermaid::
  :caption: Railway oriented programming.

   graph LR
       S1 -- Map --> S3
       S3 --> S5
       S5 --> S7

       F2 -- Alt --> F4
       F4 --> F6
       F6 --> F8

       S1 -- Fail --> F2
       F2 -- Fix --> S3
       S3 -- Fail --> F4
       S5 -- Fail --> F6
       F6 -- Fix --> S7

       style S1 fill:green
       style S3 fill:green
       style S5 fill:green
       style S7 fill:green
       style F2 fill:red
       style F4 fill:red
       style F6 fill:red
       style F8 fill:red

Returning execution to the right track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also support two special methods to work with "failed"
types like ``Failure``:

- :func:`~returns.primitives.container.Rescueable.rescue`
  is the opposite of ``bind`` method
  that works only when container is in failed state
- :func:`~returns.primitives.container.Fixable.fix`
  transforms error to value (failure became success)
  that works only when container is in failed state,
  is the opposite of ``map`` method
- :func:`~returns.primitives.container.UnwrapableFailure.alt`
  transforms error to another error
  that works only when container is in failed state,
  is the opposite of ``map`` method

``fix`` can be used to fix some fixable errors
during the pipeline execution:

.. code:: python

  from returns.result import Failure, Result

  def double(state: int) -> float:
      return state * 2.0

  result: Result[Any, float] = Failure(1).alt(double)
  # => Failure(2.0)

  result: Result[float, int] = Failure(1).fix(double)
  # => Success(2.0)

``rescue`` should return one of ``Success`` or ``Failure`` types.
It can also rescue your flow and get on the successful track again:

.. code:: python

  from returns.result import Result, Failure, Success

  def tolerate_exception(state: Exception) -> Result[int, Exception]:
      if isinstance(state, ZeroDivisionError):
          return Success(0)
      return Failure(state)

  value: Result[int, Exception] = Failure(ZeroDivisionError())
  result: Result[int, Exception] = value.rescue(tolerate_exception)
  # => Success(0)

  value2: Result[int, Exception] = Failure(ValueError())
  result2: Result[int, Exception] = value2.rescue(tolerate_exception)
  # => Failure(ValueError())


Note::

  Not all containers support these methods.
  IO cannot be fixed or rescued.

Unwrapping values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And we have two more functions to unwrap
inner state of containers into a regular types:

- :func:`.value_or <returns.primitives.container.Unwrapable.value_or>`
  returns a value if it is possible, returns ``default_value`` otherwise
- :func:`.unwrap <returns.primitives.container.Unwrapable.unwrap>`
  returns a value if it is possible, raises ``UnwrapFailedError`` otherwise

.. code:: python

  from returns.result import Failure, Success
  from returns.maybe import Some, Nothing

  Success(1).value_or(None)
  # => 1

  Some(0).unwrap()
  # => 0

  Failure(1).value_or(default_value=100)
  # => 100

  Failure(1).unwrap()
  # => Traceback (most recent call last): UnwrapFailedError

  Nothing.unwrap()
  # => Traceback (most recent call last): UnwrapFailedError

The most user-friendly way to use ``.unwrap()`` method is with :ref:`pipeline`.
We even discourage using ``.unwrap()`` without a ``@pipeline``.

For failing containers you can
use :func:`.failure <returns.primitives.container.Unwrapable.failure>`
to unwrap the failed state:

.. code:: python

  Failure(1).failure()
  # => 1

  Success(1).failure()
  # => Traceback (most recent call last): UnwrapFailedError

Be careful, since this method will raise an exception
when you try to ``.failure()`` a successful container.

Note::

  Not all containers support these methods.
  IO cannot be unwrapped.


Immutability
------------

We like to think of ``returns`` as immutable structures.
You cannot mutate the inner state of the created container,
because we redefine ``__setattr__`` and ``__delattr__`` magic methods.

You cannot also set new attributes to container instances,
since we are using ``__slots__`` for better performance and strictness.

Well, nothing is **really** immutable in python, but you were warned.

.. _type-safety:

Type safety
-----------

We try to make our containers optionally type safe.

What does it mean?

1. It is still good old ``python``, do whatever you want without ``mypy``
2. If you are using ``mypy`` you will be notified about type violations

We also ship `PEP561 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/>`_
compatible ``.pyi`` files together with the source code.
In this case these types will be available to users
when they install our application.

We also ship custom ``mypy`` plugins to overcome some existing problems,
please make sure to use them,
since they increase your developer experience and type-safety:

- ``decorator_plugin`` to solve untyped `decorator issue <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3157>`_

.. code:: ini

  [mypy]
  plugins =
    returns.contrib.mypy.decorator_plugin

You can have a look at the suggested ``mypy``
`configuration <https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/master/setup.cfg>`_
in our own repository.

.. _composition:

Composition
-----------

You can and should compose different containers together.
Here's the full table of compositions that make sense:

- ``IO[Result[A, B]]`` âœ…
- ``IO[Maybe[A]]`` âœ…
- ``IO[IO[A]]`` ðŸ¤”, use :func:`join <returns.converters.flatten>`
- ``Maybe[Maybe[A]]`` ðŸ¤”, use :func:`join <returns.converters.flatten>`
- ``Result[Result[A, B], C]`` ðŸ¤”, use :func:`join <returns.converters.flatten>`
- ``Result[Maybe[A], B]`` ðŸ¤”,
    use :func:`maybe_to_result <returns.converters.maybe_to_result>`
- ``Maybe[Result[A, B]]`` ðŸ¤”,
    use :func:`result_to_maybe <returns.converters.result_to_maybe>`
- ``Result[IO[A], B]`` ðŸš«
- ``Result[A, IO[A]]`` ðŸš«
- ``Result[A, Maybe[B]]`` ðŸš«
- ``Result[A, Result[B, C]]`` ðŸš«
- ``Maybe[IO[A]]`` ðŸš«

You can use :ref:`converters` to convert ``Maybe`` and ``Result`` containers.
So, you don't have to compose them.

You can also use :func:`join <returns.converters.flatten>`
to merge nested containers.


.. _converters:

Converters
----------

We have several helper functions
to convert containers from ``Maybe`` to ``Result`` and back again:

- ``maybe_to_result`` that converts ``Maybe`` to ``Result``
- ``result_to_maybe`` that converts ``Result`` to ``Maybe``

That's how they work:

.. code:: python

  from returns.converters import maybe_to_result, result_to_maybe
  from returns.maybe import Maybe
  from returns.result import Result

  result: Result[int, Exception]
  maybe: Maybe[int] = result_to_maybe(result)
  new_result: Result[int, None] = maybe_to_result(maybe)

Take a note, that type changes.
Also, take a note that ``Success(None)`` will be converted to ``Nothing``.

join
~~~~

You can also use ``join`` to merge nested containers together:

.. code:: python

  from returns.converters import flatten
  from returns.maybe import Maybe
  from returns.result import Success
  from returns.io import IO

  assert flatten(IO(IO(1))) == IO(1)
  assert flatten(Maybe(Maybe(1))) == Maybe(1)
  assert flatten(Success(Success(1))) == Success(1)

coalesce
~~~~~~~~

You can use :func:`returns.converters.coalesce_result`
and :func:`returns.converters.coalesce_maybe` converters
to covert containers to a regular value.

These functions accept two functions:
one for successful case, one for failing case.

.. code:: python

  from returns.converters import coalesce_result
  from returns.result import Success, Failure

  def handle_success(state: int) -> float:
      return state / 2

  def handle_failure(state: str) -> float:
      return 0.0

  coalesce_result(handle_success, handle_failure)(Success(1))
  # => returns `0.5`
  coalesce_result(handle_success, handle_failure)(Failure(1))
  # => returns `0.0`
